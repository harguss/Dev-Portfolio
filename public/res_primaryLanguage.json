      "description": "I'm Susan Hargus and I am an aspiring software developer. Although my background is in fine art, specifically painting portraits and landscapes, I have always been interested in technology and programming. I decided to pursue a career in software development because I believe that my creativity and problem-solving skills, honed through my fine art training, will be valuable assets in this field. I am currently work in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am eager to continue learning and expanding my skil lset in order to become a valuable asset to any development team. I am excited about the opportunity to work with a company that values creativity and problem-solving in its employees.I believe that my background in fine art will bring a unique perspective to the software development process, and I am confident that I can make a valuable contribution to any team. Thank you for considering me for a position at your company.",
